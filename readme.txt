The 4 example files reproduce the tests in examples 1-4
This folder also contains adapted TOST functions that also provide Bayes factors. 
(Incorporating the BF in the TOST package is work in progress.)
The plots folder contains the plots and the code to reproduce them (see readme in that folder)
The check)functions folder are tests to validate the functions used in the R files
The tutorials folder contains tutorials on how to perform equivalence tests and calculate Bayes factors. 
The Wiens_functions folder contains functions made by others (see the notes in these folders)
The left_overs folders contains some files that can probably be deleted but that we are keeping just to be sure.
