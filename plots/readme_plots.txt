H0_EQ_plot.R creates figure 1
Plots_Bayes_Priors.R create figure 2
example_plots_pretty.R creates the Figures for the examples 1, 2, and 4.
Example_3_Westerhof_corr_R1 in the main folder created Figure 5 - it uses beta instead of the correlation, so it was coded specifically for example 5.
The remaining R files in the plot folder consist of slightly adapted TOSTER functions, that create better pictures.
